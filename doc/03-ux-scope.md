UX Fundamentals: The Scope Plane
---

### Defining Scope
- Avoid perpetual beta
  - Defining scope forces all players to address potential conflicts before time is invested in designing or building
  - Documenting scope provides a reference point for work to be done and a common way to describe that work
  - Lean/agile discourages lengthy documentation but the result is often a product with a slew of features in various states of completeness => this is a MESS!
  - Documentation doesnt have to be epic but a common understanding of features, schedules, and milestones puts the end squarely in sight.
- Know what you're building
  - Clear description of what you're going to build tells everyone involved what the project's goals are and when they'll be reached
  - With no documented requirements, you're playing "telephone"
- Know what you're NOT building
  - New features often sound like good ideas, but may not support the strategic objectives of the project
  - Ideas for new features almost always emerge after a project is underway
  - Clearly identified requirements provide a framework for determining how or if additional ideas fit into what you've already committed to build
  - Identify what's doable now and what has to wait
- Tradeoffs are essential to strategy.  They create the need for choice and they purposefully limit what a company offers.

### Symptoms of Poorly Defined Scope
  - Too big - unrealistic delivery expectations, slipping deadlines, "can't we also have ____?", nervous designers and developers
  - Too small - unclear path to the full vision, too many unknowns or unasked/unanwered questions, unremarkable and unimpressive releases
  - Scope creep - "death by 1000 cuts" - too many small change requests eventually creates a snowball effect and becomes unmanageable, inability to say "no"

### The Long Wow
- "The Long Wow" - provide new experiences and recurring delight/surprise to the users of your product.  How will your product systematically impress customers over the life of their relationship with the product.  Define the evolution of your product.
- Product evolution
  - Pack in features up front
  - Unfold new experiences over time
  - Continuously evolve and integrate new features
- Planning for Product Evolution
  - Identify touchpoints for delivery.  Where and how will your users interact with your product (ie. Nike pedometer used the wearable device, the iphone, and a website)
  - Tackle wide area of unmet need.  Where is user experience lacking?  Are there new opportunities for innovation?  Are there existing ones that are executed poorly?
  - Create a repeatable delivery process.  Focus on the impact of the experience with your product.  How does the experience bring something new and enjoyable to the consumer?  
  - Plan and stage wow experiences.  Observe user feedback and evolve your product.  Create a pipeline of new features that will continue to wow product users.

### Functional Specifications
- Requirements apply to the product and its individual features
- Level of detail in your requirements depends on scope: more complexity means more requirements
- Best source of requirements are your users but requirements will also come from stakeholders

### Three Categories of Functional Requirements
- Things people say they need
  - We make very confident (but equally false) predictions about our future behavior.
  - There is a huge difference between imagining how you'd use something and actually using it.
  - Our preferences at any given time are influenced by our emotions, our health, and our environment
- Things they actually need
  - When we have a problem, it can be effortless to imagine a solution that will solve it.
  - The solution will often address a symptom instead of the underlying problem.
  - Exploring those solutions often leads to completely different requirements that solve the real problem.
- Things they don't know they need
  - When you get people talking, you may hit upon great ideas that didn't occur to anyone beforehand.
  - These ideas often come out of brainstorming, where people can openly talk through and explore possibilities.
  - "People don't want quarter-inch drills - they want quarter-inch holes."
  - Talk problems instead of solutions

### Creating Useful Functional Requirements
- Explore contextual user scenarios - short, simple narratives that describe how someone might go about fulfilling a need
- Follow these 3 guidelines:
  - Be positive - use positive statements instead of negative statements (ie. The system will not allow the user to purchase a fishing reel without fishing line. => The system will suggest visiting the fishing line page if he tries to buy a fishing reel wihout line).  
  - Be specific - avoid general or broad statements (ie. The site will be accessible to disabled people. => The site will contain inline audio help for people with impaired vision or blindness)
  - Be objective - avoid subjective statements (ie. The site will be cool and hip => The site will conform to company brand guidelines)


### Content Requirements
- Consider all content types: images, audio, video, etc.
- Content has major impact on UXD decisions:
  - Content format and purpose
  - Content size - word count, pixel dimensions, file size, bandwidth
  - Resources needed to produce each type of content
- Content should be strategic - appropriate for business and users
- Content should be appropriate - delivery method, style & structure, subject & substance

### Generating Content Requirements
- Identify content sources as early as possible
- Identify inappropriate content as early as possible
- Validate every suggested content feature against the project's strategic objectives.  Does it tell a compelling story?
- Remember that all content ideas sound great when somebody else is responsible for creating them!
- If design or development proceeds without content features and sourcing clearly identified and validated, the product is bound for failure

### Asking the Right Questions About Content
- Who's going to create the content?
- Who's going to edit and approve the content?
- Who's going to manage and update the content?
- What type of content are competitors delivering?
- Will people find the content useful and valuable?  
- How will people find your content?
- How many different types of content are there?
- Where do content types fit within the site structure?
- How are we going to display the content?
- What are the form factor restrictions for content?  (desktop, tablet, mobile, etc)

### Content Should be Contextual
- Physical considerations - environment, stimuli, activity, habits, disability
- Emotional considerations - psychological state, stress level, wants, needs
- Cognitive considerations - cognitive assumptions, learning ability, education

### Content Should be User Centric
- Design the site map to reflect prioritized user needs
- Match users' model of the world and the ways they use specific terms and phrases
- Avoid "happy talk" (ie. "We are a leading provider of blah blah blah..."). Instead, focus on "Here's what's in it for you."


### Generating Requirements
- Requirements can't be gathered.  They have to be discovered.
- Much of what's provided in a "gathering" session is based on executive opinion, technology preferences, or what customers claim they want.  Observing users is far more valuable.
- "Gathering" gives the impression that the job at hand is to take orders.
- Without good tools to evaluate possible requirements, what goes and what stays is left to popular opinion and political compromise.
- Requirements are not features.  Requirements state needs instead of solutions.  Features state solutions.  This gives everyone the chance to see opportunities and come up with better solutions.

### Different Types of Requirements
- Objectives - what does the user want to accomplish?
- Functional - what does the user need to do in order to reach their objective?  What's involved?
- Non-Functional - what constraints does the site or app have to perform within?
- Business Rules - what dynamic constraints do we have to meet? (calculations, definitions, legal, etc.)

### Creating Contextual Use Scenarios Questions
- Who are the users?
- What information do they need?
- What actions do they need to take?
- What should the system do in response?
- What does it take to make that happen?
- Are there multiple ways to do that?  What are the trade-offs?

### Creating Contextual Use Scenarios Steps
- Identify the scenarios you need
  - What situations does the user finds themselves in?
  - What major activities does the user undertake?
  - Do activities occur together (yes => group them in a scenario, no => add an additional scenario)
- Develop each story (scenario)  
  - What actions does the user take?
  - Why does the user act?
  - When/how often does this happen?
  - What data is exchanged?
  - What design principles apply?
- Communicate each scenario
  - Create a compelling narrative
  - Scenarios should be visual, not verbal!
  - Use high-level diagrams
  - Use sketched storyboards
  - Share and discuss with stakeholders

### Prioritizing Requirements
- Link requirements to strategic objectives
- Does the requirement fulfill a user need?
- Does the requirement fulfill a business objective?
- How feasible is the requirement?  Will we be able to design, build, and test it?
- Are there potential conflicts between requirements?
- Rule of thumb: any requirment not in line with project strategy is out of scope.
- How does each requirement affect the product?  Useful, sellable, buildable?
- Consider external forces.  Every forces evolves requirements: audience needs, client desires, ethical obligations, aesthetic inclinations, material properties, cultural presuppositions, functional requirements, time, budget, resources, etc.

### Scope Takeaways
- Defining scope forces all players to see and address potential conflicts and rough spots before time is invested in designing an building
- Best source for requirements are your users but remember that that what they say they need may not be what they actually need.  And there may be things they don't know they need.
- Content should be user-centered and has major impact on user experience
- Requirements aren't gathered - they're generated.  Most of the time, requirements are negotiated.
- Contextual use scenarios are your best friend.
- The most critical requirements and specification should align strategic objectives.
- Every force evolves requirements.
