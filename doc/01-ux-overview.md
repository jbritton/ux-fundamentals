UX Fundamentals: Overview

### User Experience Design Overview
What UXD isn't:
- User interface design - that's only part of it.
- A step in a process - you don't do it and then move on, it is continuous and ongoing.
- About technology - it spans many disciplines outside of digital products.  
- Just usability - usability alone does not make a successful product.  Usability is one attribute of UXD.
- Just about the user - a value loop, value goes out to users and value is returned to the business (money, time saved, etc.)  Business objectives must also be met.  Seek the sweet spot between user's needs and business goals.

What UXD is:
- User experience design is any interaction with any product, any artifact, any system.
- Formal definition - user experience simply refers to the way a product behaves and is used in the real world.  A positive user experience is one in which the goals of both the user and the organization that created the product are met.
- UXD is sum of business goals, user/customer goals, user interface, and backend process

Attributes of Good Products
- useful, desirable, accessible, credible, findable, usable
- these make it valuable

UXD Activities
  - user research - who is it for, what is valuable to them, what do they expect
  - interaction design - how do they interact with it, do they understand how to interact with it
  - visual design - what the see
  - information architecture - organization of content needed to perform certain tasks
  - front-end development - complex logic and data that drives interactive applications
  - writing/context - language and words drive useful and engaging experiences
  - user testing - validate assumptions and design decisions

We use things when:
- We can easily figure out how to accomplish our task
- The steps involved in accomplishing the task seem simple (no matter how complex)
- Our sense of effort and cognitive load are minimized
- Immediate, clear feedback is provided for interactions
- Our potential for error is minimized.  And when we make a mistake, we can get back on track quickly


### Elements of User Experience
- There are 5 elements or "planes" of UX, ranging from abstract to concrete:
  - Strategy - site, system, or app's reason for being
  - Scope - feature and functions contained wihtin the site, system, or app
  - Structure - number of places you can go, organized contextually
  - Skeleton - optimized organization and arrangement of visual elements
  - Surface - UI screens, images, text, things users can interact with
- The planes are interdependent

### Strategy Plane Overview
- What are the user needs?
  - What do they want and expect from us?
  - How does that fit in with their other goals?
- What are the business objectives?
  - Business objectives define success and typically mean making money, saving money, or both.
- Both user needs and business objectives need to be measurable.  How will we know if we've succeeded?

### Scope Plane Overview
- Strategy becomes scope when user needs and business objectives are translated into requirements for content and functionality.
- Functional specification - what is our feature set?
- Content requirements - what content will be presented, where is it from, how does it provide value to the user, etc?

### Structure Plane Overview
- Scope is given structure when we define how the system responds to user actions
- Interaction design - creates a structured experience of patterns and sequences that present appropriate options to users.
- Information architecture - defines the volume of content, along with how it's organized, arranged, and prioritized.

### Skeleton Plane Overview
- Structure informs the skeleton of the system - what it may look like and how users move through tasks and information.
- Interface design - determines how to best arrange and present visual elements for the user to interact with.
- Navigation design - onscreen elements allow users to move through tasks and information intuitively.

### Surface Plane Overview
- Visual design (aka Look and Feel) - uses colors, images, typography, and effects, each specifically chosen to:
  - Support and reinforce the meaning of content
  - Guide the user through data, tasks, or information
  - Reduce cognitive load, enable recognition, and increase intuitive learning
  - Be culturally/socially appropriate
