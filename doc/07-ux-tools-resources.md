UX Fundamentals: Tools and Resources
---

### Tools of the Trade
- Analytics - evaluating quantitative data to understand what people are doing when using a product or service
  - Good for identifying interesting user behavior, focusing research activities on learning why they behave that way
  - Bad for projects with very tight deadlines and small budgets, clients who have no data, explaining the complete reason behind user behavior (only tell part of the story)
- Competitor Benchmarking - evaluating competitor products to determine strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities to innovate with your product
  - Good for projects where lots of competitors exist, clients in industries you're familiar with, great way to immerse yourself in a new world
  - Bad for projects with tight schedules that don't allow time to do this activity, sectors you're intimately familiar with
- Contextual Research - conducting research in the users' typical environment
  - Good for gaining accurate insight into the problems people face and how they reach in their own environment, uncovering the current methods they use to overcome problems
  - Bad for projects with very tight deadlines and small budgets
- Experience Maps - a visualization of a process that users follow before, during and after using a product or service, identifies how users flow through your product, and whether that flow is efficient or needs improvement
  - Good for visualizing the entire customer journey and highlighting where a product meets user needs, keeping steps to complete a task to a minimum, ensuring key tasks are easy to accomplish
  - Bad for single step tasks, projects with very tight deadlines and small budgets
- Guerilla Usability Testing - very informal user involvement when little or no budget exists for usability testing
  - Good for involving users when project budgets aren't big enough for large scale user research, gaining quick user opinions to help to evolve your design concepts
  - Bad for recruiting participants for a specific scenario or use case, situation where you need the client to observe
- Expert Review - an expert evaluates an existing product based on a set of usability guidelines, the target users and their tasks
  - Good for gathering a quick understanding of the product's key usability and UX issues
  - Bad for acquiring a deep, thorough understanding of real user issues
- Ideation Workshop - a collaborative design method to help you and your client decide on design solutions.
  - Good for generating a shared vision for the UX design work, getting early input from different disciplines, such as visual designers and front-end developers
  - Bad for clients who don't want to be involved in the design work
- Information Architecture - process of organizing information to make content relationships obvious and its retrieval as simple as humanly possible
  - Good for creating an information structure and means of navigating designed to reflect the specific user and business needs of a product or service.  An essential component of any project.
  - Bad for extremely small projects such as designing emails and campaign landing pages.
- Lab Usability Testing - involving end users in the design process in order to understand their needs, find out how they do things and see if they can use the product in a controlled, neutral environment
  - Good for involving clients in user research and observing tests in real time, testing what you want with the right people in a controlled environment
  - Bad for projects with very tight deadlines and small budgets, environment-specific products - the controlled environment might influence user behavior
- Personas - short, vivid descriptions of fictional characters who represent a product's users.
  - Good for giving production teams need an easy way to understand user needs and core tasks, getting production teams to think about their users via collaborative persona-building exercises
  - Bad for situations where you can't do research with real users to generate personas from.  Situation where personas are generated externally with no opportunity to integrate them with the teams who will need to use them.
- Prototyping - mocking up ideas quickly in an interactive form that brings them to life to elicit stakeholder, user, and development team feedback
  - Good for producing something that allows team members and stakeholders to have a shared understanding and approval of the direction it's taking, creating a candidate design for user testing
  - Bad for projects with very tight deadlines and small budgets, complicated prototypes can be time consuming to revise.
- Requirements Workshops - gather key stakeholders to discuss the product's use, conduct exercises to give you a deeper understanding of what people need the product to do and why they need those things.
  - Good for complex design challenges, complex clients, disparate teams.
  - Bad for projects with very tight deadlines and small budgets
- Stakeholder Interviews - talking to key individuals within your client's organization to understand business requirements.
  - Good for getting information about the business goals for your project, clients with lots of people who have a vested interest in the success of the project
  - Bad for projects with extremely short turnarounds, making technical, functional, or visual design decisions.
- Surveys - collecting information from a geographically scattered set of people by asking them to respond to a predetermined set of questions
  - Good for collecting information from a geographically scattered set of people quickly, collecting both qualitative and quantitative information
  - Bad for data accuracy, requires a large number of participants to allow for error and subjectivity, quickly analyzing results because qualitative data analysis is time consuming
- Task Models - descriptions of the activities users perform in order to reach their goals
  - Good for ensuring your product matches user needs and expectations, providing insights into buying processes
  - Bad for projects with very tight deadlines and small budgets
- Wireframes - static diagrams that represent the framework of a product, exploring content, navigation, and interactions.
  - Good for exploring design and interaction ideas before visual design/development, testing ideas with users, refining ideas based on feedback and test results, agreeing on the direction with stakeholders
  - Bad for highly interactive (or technically complex) products that need to be used in order to be understood.
