UX Fundamentals: The Strategy Plane
---

### Research Process
- Stakeholder interviews - stakeholders are anyone who has a vested interest in the outcome, find out what success looks like in the minds of all stakeholders.
- Competitor review - what are competitors doing, is it working, do they have users, what do their user like/dislike about their product?
- User interviews and/or research - what are the goals of your users, how do they accomplish their tasks, what tools do they currently use, what do they like/dislike about these tools, what does their typical day look like, etc.?
- Audit your existing product - talk to stakeholders and identify the strengths/weaknesses of your product, how could your product be improved, how does it stack up against to competitor products?
- Analyze and review - review your feedback, identify patterns in the feedback, use these patterns to inform what features your product needs

### Business Goals: Stakeholder Questions
- What should the product accomplish for the business?
- Who are your customers (or users)?
- How does this project fit with your business strategy?
- How do you expect to differentiate this product?
- What technology decisions have already been made?
- Why do customers use a product like this one?
- If they use a competitor's product instead, what's the reason?
- What things do customers complain or ask about most often?

### B2B User Questions
- What is your background and role at the company?
- What makes a good workday for you?
- How does [function or process] work here?
- What are the different groups and roles involved in [function or process]?  How do they work together?
- How does this compare to your previous companies?
- What are the biggest problems and inefficiencies in [function or process]?
- What are the other systems or processes that work with this one?

### B2C User Questions
- What makes a good experience?  (ex. shopping, watching, etc.)
- What things would you usually do first here?  Why?
- What would you put off as long as you can here?  Why?
- How often do you use this product?  Or this kind of product?
- What do you use it for most often?
- Could you show me how you do that?  (What a user says they do is not always what they actually do exactly)
- What things do you use before, during, or after this product?
- How would you compare this product to others you've used?

### 3 Crucial Questions
1. What's worth doing?
2. What are we creating?
3. What value does it provide?

### First Use Questions
Upon seeing a product for the first time:
- What is this?
- Is this what I expected to see?
- Does it look credible and trustworthy?
- Does it offer what I want?  
- Does it look valuable enough to stick around?
- What actions can I take now?
- How do I learn more?
- How do I contact someone?
