UX Fundamentals: The Skeleton Plane
---

### Defining Skeleton
- Focuses on concrete issues of presentation
  - What form will the product take?
  - How will users move around and do things?
  - How will content be presented and manipulated
- Created through interface design which provides users with the ability to do things
- Comprised of navigation design which provides user with the ability to go places

### Key Principles of Positive User Experience
- Rapidly establish value in the user's mind
- Lead user toward continuing the experience
- Introduce specific content at the most relevant and appropriate points in the experience
- Add immediate value each click/tap
- Add positively to the overall experience over time with each interaction

### Features vs. Usability
- The number of functions available onscreen has a direct effect on how useful the product is
- The more functions shown, the less useful they are.

### Using Conventions
- Habit and reflex account for much of our daily interactions.
- Our ability to do anything depends on the accumulation of reflexes, most of which are pretty small
- Convention is what allows us to use those reflexes
- Conventions often match our expectation of what something is supposed to do or be like
- The only time you should deviate from well-established conventions is when there's a clear, obvious benefit to doing so

### Interface Design: the Balancing Act
- Success in UI design comes from balance between visual form and technical function
- You have to give people the things they need or need
- You have to give it to them when and where they want it
- You have to deliver it in a visual format that ensures they can access all of it

### Interface Design: Every Element Counts
- Organization of content
- Layout of the screen
- Use of audio and video
- How people use their hands and fingers to move through data
- The bottom line: an app or site whose interface is difficult to use **won't be used**

### Interface Design: A Few Ground Rules
- To most people, the UI is the system
- A well designed UI allows people to start using it immediately with little or no help
- UI design has to be audience-appropriate.  Just because you understand it doesn't mean that someone else will
- Inappropriate UI design is the number one killer of great product ideas
- It's better to perfectly meet the needs of the critical few than to poorly meet the needs of many

### Interface Design: Core Principles
- Predictability - labels, instructions, icons, and images set expectations about what to do, what will happen, where the user will go, how the screen will respond
- Consistency - usability improves when similar parts are expressed in similar ways.  Functionally consistent => use it once, learn it forever
- Progressive disclosure - everything should progress naturally from simple to complex.  Only the necessary or requested information is displayed at any given time.  This helps people manage complexity without becoming confused, frustrated, or disoriented (reduces noise).
- Intuitive - "single-trial learning".  Interactions should be easy to learn and easy to remember.
- Context and Hierarchy - functionally or logically connected items are visually grouped together, information is in order of importance, visual layout is consistent w/ user's mental model, visual hierarchy matches what user expects to do first, second, third, etc.
- Hick's Law - every additional choice increases the time required to make a decision.  The more choices you give people, the easier it is to choose nothing.  In the era of infinite choice, people need better filters.

### Navigation Design Overview
- The navigation system along with content and context should help a user understand where they are
- Navigation design starts with the site map
- Does your navigation pass the "trunk test"?  If you were blindfolded, thrown in the trunk of a car, and then dropped off in some random area, could you answer these questions?
  - Where am I?  How did I get here?  What can I do here?  Where can I go from here? => Is your navigation good?
  - Navigation provides a strong sense of place, sets the correct expectations, and makes it possible for users to accurately predict the outcomes of your interactions.

### Navigation Design: Core Principles
- How do you find what you want?
  - Browsing via a navigation system
  - Searching via keywords and phrases
  - Using filters to narrow large lists and sets of information
  - Using pagination controls to provide location information, a sense of depth/breadth, and ability to navigate large information sets
- How do you reveal depth of the site content before people navigate?
  - Dynamic sub-menus on main navigation menu
  - Search results => volume, filtering, and pagination
  - Using indicators and context to provide a sense of place (ie. a breadcrumb)
- Information scent - people estimate based on what they see how much useful information they're likely to find on a given path.  They will switch paths if the "information scent" is weak.
- The path is rarely direct.  People meander and follow links based on contextual relevance, interest, and whim.  Consider indirect paths (search, filters, tags, context links, etc.) in addition to your primary navigation menu.

### Navigation Design: Using Icons and Label for Navigation
- Representational icons have clear meaning based on their similarity to familiar objects
- Abstract icons typically require context and experience to learn their meanings
  - How important is it that someone can recognize and act on an icon-based cue?
  - Is there additional context that tells them what to do or what this is?
  - Is there time for them to figure it out? (ie. mission critical apps don't afford time for users to figure stuff out)

### Navigation Design: Tips for Solid Navigation
- Use meaningful labels for navigation items, links, and buttons
- Reduce memory load by ensuring the navigation and links are visible, findable, and informative.
- Reduce cognitive friction by ensuring that people dont need to study or decode the navigation system
- Enable users to find and use information quickly - not spend time looking for it
- Be consistent - use the same interactions, behaviors, and visual styles throughout the entire application.  
- Elements of navigation should never appear/disappear, rearrange their order, move to a different location.

### Convention and Metaphor Overview
- Appearance and location of common navigation systems have evolved over time to become conventions
- Those conventions tell us what to look for and where to look when we need them
- Putting them in a standard place allows us to locate them quickly
- Standardizing appearance makes it easy to pick them out among everything else
- It is frustrating when one of these conventions is broken

### Convention and Metaphor: Web Conventions
- Site header - site ID, search, main navigation, site utilities (account, signin, order status, help, etc.), shopping cart (for ecommerce sites)
- Local navigation (left side) - provides links within the current section
- Page name - reiterates where the user is within the site
- Current/new feature - a hero graphic linking to more details about a new feature or product
- Social proof - customer favorites, highest rated products, etc.

### Convention and Metaphor: Value of Conventions
- Convention allows us to apply accumulated habits and reflexes in different circumstances.
- Conventions often become standards for devices that have nothing to do with the one that started the idea.
- Your interface design should be consistent with others your users are already familiar with.
- Your interface should also be consistent with itself.

### Convention and Metaphor: Using Metaphors
- Just like spoken metaphors provide shortcuts in language, visual metaphors provide shortcuts for use.
- Intuitive UIs often lean on metaphors that we recognize from day-to-day life.
- Affordances - visual cues that explain what you can do and how you can do it.
- Gaming and entertainment apps benefit greatly from metaphor.

### Convention and Metaphor: Abusing Metaphors
- Use metaphors with caution.
- Metaphors are usually culturally subjective.  
- Metaphors require mental effort.
- Metaphors can obscure the nature of the feature instead of revealing it.
- Metaphors that have universal understanding are hard to come by.

### Information Design Overview
- It's typically invisible unless it's bad (ie. a form that's difficult to complete results in errors, poor instructions that cause frustration or even danger, manufacturing UIs that don't warn of potential danger, websites that are difficult to navigate or unpleasant to look at)
- Information design is the glue that holds everything together
- How do we present information so people understand it more easily?
- Focus is on the effectiveness of the form - does it communicate clearly?
- Think of it as "sense-making".  Can the user make sense of what is happening?
- Good information design supports the goals of both the user and the creator.

### Info Design: Appropriate Organization
- Context is everything.
- Information elements should be grouped and arranged in ways that:
  - Reflect how users think
  - Match what they expect
  - Support their tasks and goals

### Info Design: Organization Methods
- Alphabetical order - use when information is referential (ie. dictionary, encyclopedia), when you need non-linear access to specific items is required (ie. contact list), when no other organizing strategy is appropriate (use as the default)
- Categorical - use when there's clusters of similarity exist within the information (ie. college catalog, statistical report), when people will naturally seek out information by category (ie. dept store, ecommerce sites, etc.)
- Continuum - use when organizing by magnitude, lowest to highest, worst to best (ie. search engine results, stats), use when comparing things using a common measure (ie. processor speed, amount of storage space)
- Location - use when orientation and wayfinding are important (ie. emergency exit maps, travel guides), information is contextually related to geography (ie. historical site)
- Time - use when presenting and comparing events over fixed durations (ie. tv guide, historical timelines), a time-based sequence is involved (ie. step-by-step procedure)


### Info Design: Appropriate Form
- How is information best presented?
- Inverted pyramid - lead with the most critical information, then helpful but not critical information, then nice to know information
- Visual inverted pyramid - lead with dominant visual elements, then focal points - items of equal importance, then details for those who want to know more
- Occam's Razor - the simplest solution is usually the best.
- Progressive disclosure - information presented to a person who isn't interested or ready to process it is noise.  Only necessary or requested information is displayed at any given time.
- Hick's law - every additional choice increases the time required to make a decision => too many choices can lead to indecision.

### Wireframes: Overview
- A wireframe is a skeleton of a screen, it shows the priority and organization of things on the screen
- It details how users will get to other parts of the site/app.
- Wireframes reflect the designer's ideas about: placement of elements on the screen, labeling of those elements, navigation scheme, functionality/behavior/feedback.
- Wireframes don't show: colors, typography, images, visual style of any kind

### Wireframes: Why Bother?
- Because the design has to consider:
  - How each screen fits in with the site/app/system as a whole
  - What content, links, and interactions are needed to meet both user needs and business goals
  - How all of these elements relate to each other
- It is cheap to iterate and change things.  Far cheaper than iterating on a functioning system.

### Wireframes: What They Tell Us
- What content will be included
- How that content is organized
- Which content is most important
- A given screen's location in the system
- Where users can go and what they can do
- How users will move around the system

### Wireframe: The Process
- Revisit needs and goals (strategy phase)
- Establish cores and paths
  - Cores are the primary pieces of content and functionality you want users to see and interact with
  - Users take paths to enter and leave each screen in the system
  - The goal is to prioritize content on the screen, and delineate clear paths for people to get to and from each screen
- Start sketching on paper (do not use your computer)
  - Quickly generate thumbnail sketches
  - Your goal is to get down a high volume of decent ideas of what the screen should look like.
  - Don't think about usability or information hierarchy - just get as many different ideas out of your head as possible.
- Rapid prototyping
  - Find a wireframing tool that works for you: Visio, Omnigraffle, Balsamiq, Axure, UXPin, etc.
  - Don't use PowerPoint, Illustrator, InDesign, etc.  
  - Try not to use "lorem ipsum" text.  Content design is just as important in this phase
  - Remember that what you're creating is not final design
- Ask Questions
  - Is anything important missing?
  - Is the most important content noticed first?
  - Is there anything that shouldn't be here?
  - Which content is related and how?
  - Can you get to all of the major areas for here?  And should you be able to?
  - Do all of the labels make sense?
  - Do you know what all of the elements are?
  - Is the purpose of each element clear?
  - Does the flow of tasks or information match the user's need or expectation?
  - Are additional features or functions needed?


### Skeleton Takeaways
- The skeleton plane is created through interface design, which provides users with the ability to do things, and navigation design, which provides users with the ability to go places
- Good interface design uses progressive disclosure to maximize signal and minimize noise
- A product with a poorly designed user interface won't be used no matter how technically superior the code is or how deep its functionality may be.
- Good navigation design reveals the depth of site content, provides a sense of place and allows users to predict the outcome of an interaction
- Good information design is the glue that holds things together, supporting the goals of both user and creator
- The only time you should deviate from a well-established convention is when there is a clear, obvious benefit to doing so
