UX Fundamentals: The Surface Plane
---

### Defining Surface
- Creates a visible language
- Visible language indicates context and conveys information:
  - Layout: formats, proportions, grids and organization
  - Typography: font selection and styling
  - Color: influencing perception and emotion
  - Imagery: signs, icons, and symbols
  - Sequencing: overall approach to visual storytelling
  - Visual Identity - how the organization or the product line express itself in visible language

### Principles of Effective UI Design
- Organize
  - Provide the user with a clear and consistent conceptual structure
  - Clear visual hierarchy - enables consistency, clearly signifies relationships and improves navigation
- Economize
  - Do the most with the least amount of cues.  Each element adds to the user's cognitive load.
  - Only include the elements that are critical to communication and are immediately relevant to the task at hand.
  - The most important elements and actions should be easily perceived; non-critical elements should be de-emphasized  
- Communicate
  - Match the presentation to the expectations and capabilities of the user
  - Visual design has to balance legibility, readability, typography, symbolism, multiple views, and color or texture in order to communicate successfully.
  - Pattern recognition should be prioritized over artistic or decorative concerns (especially with fonts)
  - Visual design is NOT decoration.  It should never be based on personal preference or what looks cool.
  - Ask how your design choices work, now how they look:  Do the choices support established objectives, clarify the options available, provide context and guidance, establish clear information/action priority

### Visual Design Principles
- 4 basic principles: alignment, proximity, repetition, contrast
- These principles are interconnected - you will never only apply one principle
- Alignment
  - Helps eye-tracking and visual paths for the eye to follow, reduces eye fatigue
  - Provides cognitive stability
  - Creates visual relationships
  - Every element in the UI should be aligned with one or more other elements
  - Align everything
  - Never center align paragraph text
- Proximity
  - Elements visually close to each other are perceived as a single group, related by context of use.
  - Unrelated items are visually separated
  - Group certain elements contextually to form a perceived whole
  - Negative space creates proximity.  It also enables focus.  
  - Negative space is the space between graphics, margins, gutters, columns, type, or visuals.
  - Negative space is NOT blank space.  It is a **critical element** of design.
- Repetition
  - Repetition is used to create a hierarchy of visual styles - fonts, colors, textures, and graphical elements
  - Re-using elements of those visual styles in visual elements creates cohesiveness
- Contrast
  - Contrast draws attention towards specific elements.
  - Eyes are drawn to areas of most contrast first.
  - Text is easily readable when stark, complementary colors are used.  A lack of contrast between text and background strains the eyes.

### Following the Eye
- What design element draws the user's attention first?
- Is the first object of attention a distraction from their goals?
- Is what the user is drawn to strategically important to you?
- Two patterns of visual cognition: F-pattern and Z-pattern
- Eye movement across a screen is an ingrained, instinctive response.
- When successful, patterns have two important qualities
  - The eye moves in a smooth flow - when someone says your design is "busy", it means the design doesn't lead them around the screen.
  - It gives a guided tour of what's available - without overwhelming detail.  The available choices should support the person's goals and tasks.
- Eye tracking studies are interesting but not always accurate.  Eye tracking focuses on foveal fixations (the smallest part of our visual field that produces the sharpest vision).  Eye tracking does not account for peripheral vision which makes up 98% of our visual field.

### Contrast and Uniformity
- Lack of contrast causes the eye to bounce around without setting on anything
- Contrast draws the user's attention to the essential components of the interface
- Helps the user understand relationships between navigational elements and content
- Communicates hierarchy and importance within and across multiple sets of information
- Contrast can make things users really need to see stand out (ie. error messages)
- Uniformity enables contrast and change while keeping those elements from overwhelming your users
- Uniformity in design elements allows you to apply them consistently and recombine them into new designs as the site or app grows

### Consistency
- Consistency in visual design allows users to build an accurate mental model of the way the site, app, or system work.
- Is you site or app consistent?
  - Are buttons and controls placed consistently?
  - Is language consistent in labels and messages?
  - Are font styles, images, graphic elements, and color schemes applied consistently across each screen?
  - Do buttons or controls respond to user actions consistently in terms of visual display, appropriate context and functionality?
- External inconsistency - different products within a family of products reflect different design approaches.
- Internal inconsistency - different parts or screens in the same product reflect different design approaches.

### Color
- Color is a critical visual element of most user experiences
- Color has associated meanings that create emotional responses
- To prevent confusion in meaning, color has to be used consistently
- To get the desired emotional response, color has to be used appropriately
- What color does:
  - The right colors draw the eye to the most important areas on the screen
  - Color can maximize readability and minimize optical fatigue
  - Color delivers symbolic meanings that support and enhance the visual experience of a design
  - Color pleases the eye and sustains visual interest
- Color should highlight, not determine:
  - Color should never be the sole differentiator of things in the UI
  - It should highlight and guide
  - Bright, saturated colors should only be used as visual accents.
  - Start with one dominant neutral color, then add an accent color.
- Evaluating proper color use:
    - Are colors used sparingly?
    - Do my colors reinforce or interfere with hierarchy and content?
    - Is the color scheme used consistently?
    - Is color use functional, or just decorative?
    - Does functionality depend on color?
    - Would this be just as functional for someone who's color blind?

### Typography
- Serif of sans serif?  Research shows no difference in comprehension, reading speed or preference between serif and sans-serif fonts.
- Use typography purposefully
  - If you're going to use more than on typeface, each should be visually distinct from the other
  - Use these different styles only to indicate differences in the information you're presenting
  - You can also do this with weight (ie. bold vs. regular)
  - Provide clear contrast between styles to draw user attention as needed
- Consistent styling
  - Identify different types of content: headlines, body, bullets, charts, etc.
  - Create specific style for each: font, weight, color, etc.
  - Apply these styles consistently on every screen.

### Surface Takeaways
- The surface plane can be thought of as visible (and visual) language
- This visible language is created by techniques used to indicate context and convey information: layout, typography, color, imagery, sequencing, and visual identity
- Effective visual design serves to organize, economize and communicate.
- There are four basic principles used to organize visual information: alignment, proximity, repetition and contrast.
- Good visual design leads the eye through the screen in a smooth flow, giving the user a guided tour of what's available.
- Consistency in visual design allows users to build an accurate mental model of the way the site, app or system works.
- The right colors draw the eye to the most imporant areas on the screen and influence emotional response.
- The right colors maximize readability and minimize optical fatigue.  
- If you're going to use more than one typeface, each should be visually distinct from the other.
- Use these different styles only to indicate differences in the information you're presenting.
